# Lab on Offensive Computer Security (2IC80)
## Default project group 15

This is the repository containing our group's code for ARP poisoning, DNS spoofing and SSL stripping.

The repository consists of two python files. 
One is the tool for ARP poisoning and DNS spoofing, which works. The other is the SSL stipping tool, which does not work.
We have included all code, even the tool that does not work for completion.
